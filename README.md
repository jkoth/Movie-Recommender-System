## Overview
Built a Recommender System Python application for the capstone project in Programming for Machine Learning course at DePaul University, Chicago. Application learns from user profile and returns personlized top ten movie recommendations. Application is built primarily for new users who will be promted to rate twenty randomly selected movies and based on their responses, recomendations will be calculated. In case user chooses not to input ratings, user's demographic details are used to recommend movies. Finally, in case user neither rates movies nor provides valid demographics details, a default recommendation list will be returned.
